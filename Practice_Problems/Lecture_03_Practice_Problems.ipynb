    "     - Give an example of when you would  use a set\n",
    "     - Give an example of when you would use a tuple\n",
    "     -  Give an example of when you would use range( ) \n",
    "2.  Lists\n",
    "     -  Create an empty list called _oceans_\n",
    "     -  append all the oceans to the list  \n",
    "     -  print the ocean at **index** 3 in the list  \n",
    "     -  print the last element of your list. \n",
    "     -  make a shallow copy of _oceans_ called _seas_ and a deep copy of _oceans_ called  _big_water_. Try to modify the copies. Verify that the shallow copy refers to the same underlying object while the deep copy makes an independent object.  \n",
    "     -  Apply the method **.sort()** to one of your copies and then print the copy\n",
    "3. range( )\n",
    "     -  Use the function **range( )** to create a list with a  “range” of numbers from 0 up to (but not including) 100, increment by any number (less than 100) and print the results.\n",
    "4. Tuples\n",
    "     -  Create a tuple called _continents_ with the continents as elements.\n",
    "     -  Attempt to change the second **element** (not index) in place (this should throw and error). \n",
    "     -  print out the third **element** (not index)  in the tuple\n",
    "5. Sets\n",
    "     -  create a set from the _oceans_ list you created earlier.\n",
    "     -  print out the set of oceans "
