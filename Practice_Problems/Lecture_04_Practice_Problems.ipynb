    "1. Dictionaries\n",
    "    - Create a dictionary called `geology` with  the keys  `\"Igneous\"` and `\"Metamorphic\"`.  The _values_ of these keys should be  the definition of these words.\n",
    "    - Print the value for the key `\"Igneous\"`.\n",
    "    - Add a new key-value pair `\"Sedimentary\"` with its definition.\n",
    "    - Print all of the values using the method `values()`.\n",
    "2. Conditional statements\n",
    "    - Set `x` to 5 and `y` to 6.  Test if they are equal using relational operators. Test if they are not equal using the relational operators.  \n",
    "    - `x` and `y` are not equal. Test which one is larger by using the less than and greater than relational operators.\n",
    "    - Create new variables and apply the less than or equal to and greater than or equal to relational operators to these variables.\n",
    "3. Python `while` loops\n",
    "    - Set `day` to 1 and `fullMoon` to 29.\n",
    "    - Create a `while` loop that checks if `day` is less than `fullMoon`. If it is, print `day` and increment the value of `day` by 1.\n",
    "    - If `day` is greater than or equal to `fullMoon`, print `\"Today is a full moon.\"`. \n",
    "4. Python `if` statements\n",
    "    -  Set a variable `oldestCrust` to `3.5e9`, `oldestSeafloor` to `180e6`, `ageEarth` to `4.5e9`, and  `ageSolarSystem` to `4.5e9`. \n",
    "    -  Create an \"if-else\" statement that compares the age of the crust with the age of the seafloor and prints out which is older. \n",
    "    - Create an \"if-else\" statement that compares the age of the Earth and the age of the solar system and prints out whether or not they formed at the same time.\n",
    "5. Python `for` loops\n",
    "    - Create a list of mountain ranges (Himalayas, Rocky, Trans-Antarctic, Andes, Alps, Appalachians, etc.).\n",
    "    - Write a `for` loop that prints out all of the elements in your list.\n",
    "6. Nested loops\n",
    "    - Make a dictionary of volcanoes with the volcano names as keys and the values as the most recent eruption: `\"Mt St Helen's\": 1981`, `'Pinatubo': 1992`, `'Krakatoa': 2014`, `'Anak Krakatoa': 2018`, `'Yellowstone': -68000`, `'Kilauea': 2018`.  \n",
    "    - Make a loop: Step through the dictionary of volcanoes. If the last eruption was within the last five years, then print `\"Recent activity at \"` along with the name of the volcano, otherwise print `\"No recent activity at \"` and the name of the volcano. "
