    "- Choose a volcano that has erupted at least 10 times in the Holocene.\n",
    "- Use .loc to find the 10 most explosive eruptions from this volcano.\n",
    "- Use **plt.scatter( )** to plot the start dates of the eruptions against their VEI. Use red triangles as markers.\n",

    "### 3. grouping and describing\n",
    "- Use the methods **.groupby()** and **.describe()** to find the dominant rock type in each tectonic setting. What percentage of intraplate oceanic crustal volcanoes are basaltic?\n",

    "- Use these same methods to find the primary volcano type with the lowest average elevation. Why might this type of volcano have the lowest elevation?\n"
