Examples of _objects_ that we have already encountered are the various data structures we have been using and things like plots.  Objects  have _methods_ that can be used to change an object and _attributes_ that describe features of an object.  \n",

Did you notice that the method definitions look a lot like functions, but are inside the class definition.  A _method_ is really a function, but it is special in that it belongs to a class and works on the _instance_ of the class.  They can only be called by using the name of the _instance_, followed by a dot, followed by the _method_ (with parentheses). \n",
